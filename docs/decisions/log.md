# Decision log

Dated decisions made after the five topic documents in this directory were written, plus open questions that block milestones.

The topic documents hold the settled shape of the platform by subject. This log holds individual decisions with IDs, so that `docs/STATUS.yml` can point at one and say a milestone is blocked on it. When a decision here closes, update the relevant topic document to match and leave the entry as a record of when and why.

Status values: `open`, `accepted`, `superseded`.

## D-001 Launcher

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Affects:** `desktop-shell.md`, M3, M6

`desktop-shell.md` recorded the launcher as "Quicksilver". That was autocorrect. The launcher is Quickshell, meaning a Quickshell module rather than a separate application.

Consequence: the launcher does not exist until M6. M3 needs a conventional launcher of its own, and the fallback set needs to keep one after M6 so that a broken Quickshell leaves a usable desktop. Use fuzzel.

Second consequence: Quickshell now carries the bar, notifications, clipboard UI, screenshot UI, recorder UI, sleep inhibit control and the launcher. That is a lot of function in one young QML framework with a moving API. The requirement in `desktop-shell.md` that shell choices stay replaceable rather than coupled into bootstrap logic is the control that keeps this survivable. Hold to it.

## D-002 Networking stack

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Affects:** `applications-tooling.md`, M1, M3

Use NetworkManager on both profiles.

The laptop roams between networks and hits captive portals. NetworkManager handles both without custom logic, and systemd-networkd with iwd does not. Running one stack on the desktop and another on the laptop would break the shared-core principle for a daemon that gets touched twice a year, and would double the surface where Tailscale integration can go wrong.

Consequences:

- M1 configures NetworkManager, not `systemd-networkd`. Mask `systemd-networkd` and `systemd-resolved` conflicts explicitly rather than leaving both installed and racing.
- The Quickshell bar at M6 gets a NetworkManager applet. Until then M3 uses `nmtui`.
- Verify Tailscale coexistence as part of the M3 exit criteria, per `security-power.md`.

## D-003 Audio stack

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Affects:** `applications-tooling.md`, M3

Use PipeWire with WirePlumber and the full compatibility set on both profiles: `pipewire`, `wireplumber`, `pipewire-pulse`, `pipewire-alsa`, `pipewire-jack`.

There is no serious alternative under Hyprland. Gaming on the desktop needs the PulseAudio layer. The JACK and ALSA layers cost nothing to install and save an afternoon the first time something wants them.

Consequences:

- Audio is a shared package group, not a desktop-only one. A laptop without working sound is broken, not minimal.
- Health checks at M5 assert that `wireplumber` is running and that a sink exists.

## D-004 Session entry

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Affects:** `desktop-shell.md`, `security-power.md`, M3

Use greetd with tuigreet on both profiles.

`security-power.md` requires a Secret Service implementation for keyring integration, and PAM can only unlock the keyring if it sees a password at login. Autologin gives one password at boot but leaves PAM nothing to unlock with, so the keyring prompt reappears at first use and anyone who boots the machine lands in an unlocked session. The second prompt is what buys the keyring integration, so it is the price rather than the flaw.

SDDM would give the same keyring benefit and would pick up the Kvantum theming, but it pulls a Qt stack into the boot path for a screen that is on screen for two seconds.

Consequences:

- The login password unlocks the keyring through `pam_gnome_keyring` or the equivalent for whichever Secret Service implementation gets chosen. That implementation is still unnamed in `security-power.md` and needs picking during M3.
- Hyprland launches from a greetd session command, not from a shell profile.
- Two password prompts at boot: LUKS, then greetd. D-008 decides whether the LUKS one stays.

## D-005 AUR helper and build isolation

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Affects:** `applications-tooling.md`, M2, M5

Use paru, building in a clean chroot through `devtools`.

Building on the target machine leaves `base-devel` and every AUR package's make dependencies on a workstation that is meant to be reproducible, and lets two machines drift apart in ways an M7 rebuild test cannot detect. The chroot costs setup time at M2 and slower builds, and buys a machine whose installed set matches its manifest.

aurutils with a local repository would be cleaner still for two machines, but it means maintaining a package repository, which is a subproject this platform does not need yet.

Consequences:

- M2 sets up `devtools` and the chroot before installing any AUR package.
- The update script at M5 runs AUR updates through the same chroot. Never build outside it.
- AUR packages get pinned by name in a manifest like everything else. `applications-tooling.md` already requires declarative package selection.
- Revisit aurutils if chroot build times become the reason updates get skipped.

## D-006 Secrets and key bootstrap

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Affects:** `applications-tooling.md`, `security-power.md`, M1

Use `age` for everything. Drop `git-crypt`.

The age private key lives in the repository, itself encrypted with a long diceware passphrase through `age -p`. Bootstrap prompts for the passphrase, unwraps the key, then decrypts everything else with it.

This depends on nothing external. No network, no removable media, no reachable Vaultwarden. Recovery is the point of this platform, and a rebuild path that needs a VPS to be up is a rebuild path that fails on the day it matters. Pulling the key from Vaultwarden would add the network, the VPS, the master password and a TOTP device to the list of things that must work during a rebuild.

Two encryption tools with overlapping jobs means two sets of failure modes, so `git-crypt` comes out of `applications-tooling.md`.

Consequences:

- Store the passphrase in NordPass as well. It protects everything, and forgetting it means the encrypted content is gone.
- Keep the encrypted set small. WiFi PSKs, a Tailscale auth key and service tokens belong there. SSH private keys and anything a password manager already holds do not: putting them in the repository widens what one passphrase protects for no gain.
- Bootstrap must prompt for the passphrase once and hold the unwrapped key in memory, never writing it to the new system's disk outside its final destination.
- Rotating the passphrase means re-wrapping one key, not re-encrypting every secret. That is the main practical reason for the wrapped-key layer rather than encrypting each secret with a passphrase directly.
- Add an M1 exit check: on a machine with the wrong passphrase, bootstrap fails cleanly and leaves no partial state.

## D-007 Snapshot tooling

**Status:** open
**Blocks:** M5

Choose snapper, btrbk, or a purpose-written script.

`storage-boot.md` requires a pre-update snapshot and rollback to a known-good system snapshot and config state. snapper has the widest ecosystem and a boot menu integration that does not apply here, because this platform uses UKIs rather than GRUB. btrbk handles send and receive to another host, which matters for D-009.

Recommendation: btrbk. Its send and receive support means the snapshot decision and the backup decision share one tool rather than two.

## D-008 Disk unlock during the Secure Boot deferral

**Status:** open
**Blocks:** M1

`storage-boot.md` defers Secure Boot for about a month per machine. `security-power.md` prefers controls that stay transparent during normal use. Those pull in opposite directions.

TPM2 auto-unlock of LUKS2 only means anything with Secure Boot enabled. Without it, an attacker who boots a modified UKI is handed the key. So during the deferral month, either type a passphrase at every boot, or enrol the TPM and accept an unlock that does not hold up.

Recommendation: passphrase during the deferral, TPM2 enrolment as part of M10. Thirty days of typing a passphrase beats shipping a control that pretends to work.

## D-009 Off-machine backup

**Status:** open
**Blocks:** M8

Nothing in the decision documents covers backup. Btrfs snapshots are not backups. They live on the same device as the data, so one dead SSD takes the data and every snapshot with it.

`applications-tooling.md` mentions a NAS in passing, for FSearch indexing. Decide whether that NAS is also the backup target, what gets backed up, how often, and how a restore gets tested.

This does not block VM work. It blocks putting real data on a physical machine at M8.

Recommendation: btrbk send and receive to the NAS, matching D-007, with `/home` and `@ai_models` in scope. Add a restore test to the M8 exit criteria once this closes.

## D-010 Hostname and inventory naming

**Status:** open
**Blocks:** M2

Fix the naming convention for machines before the inventory exists, because renaming later touches every group variable file.

Other repositories in this account use names such as `hmlxdesktop01`. Decide whether ArchWork follows that convention, and decide whether inventory group names stay as the plain `desktop` and `laptop` that `desktop-laptop-differences.md` uses.

Recommendation: keep the group names `desktop` and `laptop` exactly as the decision document writes them, and let host names follow the existing convention. Groups express the profile. Host names identify the box.
