# Decision log

Dated decisions made after the five topic documents in this directory were written, plus open questions that block milestones.

The topic documents hold the settled shape of the platform by subject. This log holds individual decisions with IDs, so that `docs/STATUS.yml` can point at one and say a milestone is blocked on it. When a decision here closes, update the relevant topic document to match and leave the entry as a record of when and why.

Status values: `open`, `accepted`, `superseded`.

## D-001 Launcher

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Affects:** `desktop-shell.md`, M3, M6

`desktop-shell.md` recorded the launcher as "Quicksilver". That was autocorrect. The launcher is Quickshell, meaning a Quickshell module rather than a separate application.

Consequence: the launcher does not exist until M6. M3 needs a conventional launcher of its own, and the fallback set needs to keep one after M6 so that a broken Quickshell leaves a usable desktop. Use fuzzel.

Second consequence: Quickshell now carries the bar, notifications, clipboard UI, screenshot UI, recorder UI, sleep inhibit control and the launcher. That is a lot of function in one young QML framework with a moving API. The requirement in `desktop-shell.md` that shell choices stay replaceable rather than coupled into bootstrap logic is the control that keeps this survivable. Hold to it.

## D-002 Networking stack

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Affects:** `applications-tooling.md`, M1, M3

Use NetworkManager on both profiles.

The laptop roams between networks and hits captive portals. NetworkManager handles both without custom logic, and systemd-networkd with iwd does not. Running one stack on the desktop and another on the laptop would break the shared-core principle for a daemon that gets touched twice a year, and would double the surface where Tailscale integration can go wrong.

Consequences:

- M1 configures NetworkManager, not `systemd-networkd`. Mask `systemd-networkd` and `systemd-resolved` conflicts explicitly rather than leaving both installed and racing.
- The Quickshell bar at M6 gets a NetworkManager applet. Until then M3 uses `nmtui`.
- Verify Tailscale coexistence as part of the M3 exit criteria, per `security-power.md`.

## D-003 Audio stack

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Affects:** `applications-tooling.md`, M3

Use PipeWire with WirePlumber and the full compatibility set on both profiles: `pipewire`, `wireplumber`, `pipewire-pulse`, `pipewire-alsa`, `pipewire-jack`.

There is no serious alternative under Hyprland. Gaming on the desktop needs the PulseAudio layer. The JACK and ALSA layers cost nothing to install and save an afternoon the first time something wants them.

Consequences:

- Audio is a shared package group, not a desktop-only one. A laptop without working sound is broken, not minimal.
- Health checks at M5 assert that `wireplumber` is running and that a sink exists.

## D-004 Session entry

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Affects:** `desktop-shell.md`, `security-power.md`, M3

Use greetd with tuigreet on both profiles.

`security-power.md` requires a Secret Service implementation for keyring integration, and PAM can only unlock the keyring if it sees a password at login. Autologin gives one password at boot but leaves PAM nothing to unlock with, so the keyring prompt reappears at first use and anyone who boots the machine lands in an unlocked session. The second prompt is what buys the keyring integration, so it is the price rather than the flaw.

SDDM would give the same keyring benefit and would pick up the Kvantum theming, but it pulls a Qt stack into the boot path for a screen that is on screen for two seconds.

Consequences:

- The login password unlocks the keyring through `pam_gnome_keyring` or the equivalent for whichever Secret Service implementation gets chosen. That implementation is still unnamed in `security-power.md` and needs picking during M3.
- Hyprland launches from a greetd session command, not from a shell profile.
- Two password prompts at boot: LUKS, then greetd. D-008 decides whether the LUKS one stays.

## D-005 AUR helper and build isolation

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Affects:** `applications-tooling.md`, M2, M5

Use paru, building in a clean chroot through `devtools`.

Building on the target machine leaves `base-devel` and every AUR package's make dependencies on a workstation that is meant to be reproducible, and lets two machines drift apart in ways an M7 rebuild test cannot detect. The chroot costs setup time at M2 and slower builds, and buys a machine whose installed set matches its manifest.

aurutils with a local repository would be cleaner still for two machines, but it means maintaining a package repository, which is a subproject this platform does not need yet.

Consequences:

- M2 sets up `devtools` and the chroot before installing any AUR package.
- The update script at M5 runs AUR updates through the same chroot. Never build outside it.
- AUR packages get pinned by name in a manifest like everything else. `applications-tooling.md` already requires declarative package selection.
- Revisit aurutils if chroot build times become the reason updates get skipped.

## D-006 Secrets and key bootstrap

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Affects:** `applications-tooling.md`, `security-power.md`, M1

Use `age` for everything. Drop `git-crypt`.

The age private key lives in the repository, itself encrypted with a long diceware passphrase through `age -p`. Bootstrap prompts for the passphrase, unwraps the key, then decrypts everything else with it.

This depends on nothing external. No network, no removable media, no reachable Vaultwarden. Recovery is the point of this platform, and a rebuild path that needs a VPS to be up is a rebuild path that fails on the day it matters. Pulling the key from Vaultwarden would add the network, the VPS, the master password and a TOTP device to the list of things that must work during a rebuild.

Two encryption tools with overlapping jobs means two sets of failure modes, so `git-crypt` comes out of `applications-tooling.md`.

Consequences:

- Store the passphrase in NordPass as well. It protects everything, and forgetting it means the encrypted content is gone.
- Keep the encrypted set small. WiFi PSKs, a Tailscale auth key and service tokens belong there. SSH private keys and anything a password manager already holds do not: putting them in the repository widens what one passphrase protects for no gain.
- Bootstrap must prompt for the passphrase once and hold the unwrapped key in memory, never writing it to the new system's disk outside its final destination.
- Rotating the passphrase means re-wrapping one key, not re-encrypting every secret. That is the main practical reason for the wrapped-key layer rather than encrypting each secret with a passphrase directly.
- Add an M1 exit check: on a machine with the wrong passphrase, bootstrap fails cleanly and leaves no partial state.

## D-007 Snapshot tooling

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Affects:** `storage-boot.md`, M5, M8

Use btrbk.

One declarative config covers snapshots, retention and `btrfs send`/`receive` to another host, so D-009 reuses this tool instead of adding a second one. snapper's headline feature is its GRUB menu integration, and D-011 keeps systemd-boot, so that is dead weight here. Running snapper for snapshots and btrbk for backup would mean two tools with overlapping models of the same subvolumes and two retention policies that can disagree, which is the same objection that removed `git-crypt` at D-006.

The cost is writing the pacman pre-transaction hook that `snap-pac` would have given free. That is roughly ten lines and it goes through ShellCheck like everything else.

Consequences:

- M5 writes a `/etc/pacman.d/hooks/` pre-transaction hook that calls btrbk before any package transaction.
- Retention policy lives in the btrbk config, in the repository, like all other configuration.
- Snapshots land on `@snapshots`, which `storage-boot.md` already provides.
- `@home`, `@var_log`, `@var_cache` and `@ai_models` stay outside the rollback set. btrbk still snapshots `@home` for backup purposes at D-009, but a system rollback must not touch it.

## D-008 Disk unlock during the Secure Boot deferral

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Affects:** `storage-boot.md`, `security-power.md`, M1, M10

Type the LUKS2 passphrase at every boot until Secure Boot is enabled. Enrol TPM2 as part of M10, not before.

TPM2 auto-unlock only means anything with Secure Boot on. Without it, an attacker boots a modified UKI and the TPM hands over the key, so the unlock is transparent to the user and to the attacker alike. `security-power.md` prefers controls that stay transparent during normal use, but a control that pretends to work is worse than a prompt.

Enrolling now and re-enrolling at M10 was rejected because the re-enrolment is easy to forget, and forgetting it means unlock silently keeps working against the weak policy with nothing to indicate it.

Consequences:

- Two prompts at boot during the deferral: LUKS, then greetd from D-004. One after M10.
- M10 enrols with `systemd-cryptenroll` against PCR 7 and PCR 11. PCR 11 is the UKI measurement that `systemd-stub` provides, which D-011 preserved by keeping UKIs.
- Keep a recovery key printed and stored offline before enrolling the TPM. A firmware update changes PCR values and locks you out otherwise. Add this to the M10 exit criteria.
- The M10 exit criteria already require retesting rollback and rescue with Secure Boot on. Retest TPM2 unlock after a deliberate firmware setting change too.

## D-009 Off-machine backup

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Affects:** `storage-boot.md`, M8

Back up to the NAS using btrbk send and receive. Scope is `@home` and `@ai_models`.

This reuses the D-007 tool, so one config covers snapshots, retention and backup. Incremental sends are cheap because btrfs already knows what changed between snapshots.

Everything else on the machine is reproducible from this repository, which is the point of the platform. `@home` and `@ai_models` are the only subvolumes holding data that a rebuild cannot recreate.

Consequences:

- **Verify the NAS runs btrfs before relying on this.** `btrfs receive` needs a btrfs target. A ZFS or ext4 NAS means either a btrfs-formatted dataset on it, or a different backup tool, and finding that out at M8 is late. Check during M5, when btrbk goes in.
- Residual risk accepted: the NAS is in the same building. This covers drive failure, accidental deletion and a bad update. It does not cover fire or theft. Revisit if the data on `@home` becomes worth more than that.
- Add a restore test to the M8 exit criteria. A backup nobody has restored from is a hypothesis.
- `@ai_models` is desktop-only per `desktop-laptop-differences.md`, so the laptop backs up `@home` alone.

## D-010 Hostname and inventory naming

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Affects:** `desktop-laptop-differences.md`, M2

Host names follow the existing convention: `hmlxdesktop01`, `hmlxlaptop01`. Ansible inventory groups stay `desktop` and `laptop`, exactly as `desktop-laptop-differences.md` writes them.

Groups express the profile. Host names identify the box. Keeping the two jobs separate is what lets a second laptop join the `laptop` group without any variable file changing, and it keeps ArchWork consistent with the other repositories in this account.

Consequences:

- `ansible/inventory/` defines `desktop` and `laptop` groups. `group_vars/desktop.yml`, `group_vars/laptop.yml` and `group_vars/all.yml` hold the differences from `desktop-laptop-differences.md`.
- `host_vars/` stays empty unless a genuine per-machine fact appears. A value that belongs to the profile goes in `group_vars`, not `host_vars`.
- No role, task or template reads the host name to decide behaviour. `CLAUDE.md` already forbids this.
- A rebuild being tested alongside the machine it replaces gets the next number, not a special-case name.

## D-011 Bootloader, reopened

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Affects:** `storage-boot.md`, M1, M5, M10

Keep systemd-boot with Unified Kernel Images. Do not switch to GRUB.

GRUB was reconsidered because `grub-btrfs` with snapper puts snapshots in the boot menu, making rollback a menu entry rather than a command. That is the only serious argument for it, and it is a real one.

It loses to the costs. GRUB means abandoning UKIs and returning to `grub-mkconfig`, which is exactly the ad hoc kernel parameter accumulation `storage-boot.md` warns against. Secure Boot at M10 goes from a single `sbctl` signature over one EFI binary to a standalone GRUB image with modules baked in, on a bootloader with a history of Secure Boot CVEs and DBX revocations. TPM2 measured boot loses the predictable PCR 11 measurement that `systemd-stub` provides, which D-008 depends on at M10.

The recovery UKI already covers the same need. Boot it, swap the subvolume, reboot.

One point in GRUB's favour is commonly overstated and does not apply here: GRUB cannot unlock a LUKS2 volume that uses Argon2id, but only an encrypted `/boot` needs that. This design leaves the ESP unencrypted and unlocks root from the initramfs, so the limitation is irrelevant.

Consequences:

- M1 ships a rollback script on the recovery UKI, not just a documented procedure. The gap against GRUB is keystrokes, and a script closes most of it.
- M5 exercises that script rather than a documented manual sequence.
- Revisit only if the recovery UKI path proves painful in real use, and record the evidence if so.

## D-012 Secret Service implementation

**Status:** open
**Blocks:** M3

`security-power.md` requires a Secret Service implementation for keyring integration but does not name one. D-004 depends on it, because the whole reason for choosing greetd over autologin was that PAM unlocks the keyring from the login password.

Candidates are `gnome-keyring`, KWallet, or `keepassxc` acting as the Secret Service provider.

`gnome-keyring` has the mature PAM module and is what most Wayland desktops assume. It also drags in a GNOME dependency on a Hyprland system. KWallet fits the Kvantum and Qt theming already chosen but expects more of Plasma than is present here. `keepassxc` would consolidate with the password managers in `security-power.md`, but its PAM story is weaker, which undercuts D-004.

Recommendation: `gnome-keyring`. The PAM integration is the thing being bought, and it is the only one of the three that does it well.
